 ## Objective:
 
This project outlines the concept of a third-party extension or service (henceforth known as the Read Before You Agree, or ‘RBYA’) connected to conventional browsers (such as Google Chrome) to be used in tandem with a consumer signing up for any online-based product or service with an associated ToS agreement. In addition, the RBYA may also be available as a web or app service where consumers can paste their ToS agreements which will help identify punitive and digital privacy clauses that warrant their attention according to user’s preferences and potentially provide friendlier alternative services.

## Scope: 

RBYA transformed ToS agreement to an ethic vector in 17 categories by using NLP techniques, then compared with the user’s ethics vector using cosine similarity so that RBYA can provide recommendations on whether to use the app or which app to use based on user’s comfort level.

 ## Training and Testing Data:

ToS, DR: Click ==> [Terms of Service](https://tosdr.org/)

The reason for using ToS, DR is they provide not only the punitive labels for the sentences in large companies’ ToS, but also provides a topic classification for each sentence. Both punitive and category labels are available from this website.
